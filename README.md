# ASSIGNMENT 5 - MACHINE LEARNING IN R WALKTHROUGH 
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and an environment file. The Jupyter Notebook contains my workthrough of the Machine Learning Mastery Your First Machine Learning Project tutorial on machine learning in R. The tutorial focused on practicing common methods of data manipulation and presentation and then training a machine learning model using the iris.csv data set.
